I am a final-year PhD student in Computer Science at [Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Ben Raphael](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~braphael/). I was generously supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/news/computer-science-phd-students-awarded-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship) and a [Siebel Scholar award](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/news/graduate-students-receive-siebel-scholar-awards).    

I am broadly interested in developing statistical models and algorithms to address problems in biology and machine learning. My current focuses on epistasis and modeling spatial structure in 'omics data.

## Recent Updates

- Posters/talks on Belayer and GASTON at: NCI Spring School (April 2023), NCI Junior Investigator Meeting (August 2023), Rutgers-Princeton cancer symposium (October 2023), CSHL Single-Cell Analyses meeting (November 2023).

- (November 2023) Just released our new algorithm GASTON, which uses deep learning to derive a topographic map of spatial gene expression. Check out the [pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.10.561757v1) and [code](https://github.com/raphael-group/GASTON)!

- (October 2022) Our spatial transcriptomics algorithm Belayer is out now (and is the issue's "featured article") in [Cell Systems](https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/fulltext/S2405-4712(22)00354-4)!

- (September 2022) Received a [Siebel Scholar award](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/news/graduate-students-receive-siebel-scholar-awards).

<!-- - (June 2022) Presented at the [SIAM Conference on Discrete Mathematics](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/dm22) (DM22) in Pittsburgh. Also received an ICML 2022 [Best Reviewer Award](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2022/Reviewers).

- (May 2022) Presented our algorithm [NetMix2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.31.478575v1)  at RECOMB 2022 in San Diego. -->

<!-- - (December 2021) Two papers accepted to [RECOMB 2022](https://recomb2022.net/): one on [network propagation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.31.478575v1) and another on modeling [spatial transcriptomics](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.05.479261v1) data using complex analysis. Looking forward to San Diego!

## Personal

I like to go [<span style="color:#c869bf">bouldering</span>](http://instagram.com/uthsav_climbs/), struggle on crosswords and puzzles, and make bad puns.
